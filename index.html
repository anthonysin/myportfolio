                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! I&apos;m Anthony, an aspiring front-end web developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly websites. My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how things work online, and I&apos;ve since dived into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my ideas to life. I love crafting clean, responsive designs that not only look great but also enhance the user experience. <br><br>

                As I continue to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field, I&apos;m excited to connect with fellow developers and explore new technologies. Whether it&apos;s experimenting with animations or optimizing for mobile, I&apos;m all about building websites that leave a lasting impression. Let&apos;s create something amazing together!</p>
